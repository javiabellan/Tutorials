# ML Models

## Models

 * **Softmax regression**: If you want to assign probabilities to an object being one of several different things, softmax is the thing to do, because softmax gives us a list of values between 0 and 1 that add up to 1.
 has two steps: first we add up the evidence of our input being in certain classes, and then we convert that evidence into probabilities.

## Layers

#### Final layers

 * **Softmax**: Gives a list of values between 0 and 1, that add up to 1
